This work expands the concept of ridges to Gaussian distributed
uncertain scalar fields. We present a new criterion for the uncertain
ridge extraction of co-dimension one, that counters the problems
occuring from sampling distributions of data with a lot of uncertainty.
We evaluate the differences of the conservative ridge extraction to our
new criterion, as well as the differences of matrix decompositions in
the context of Monte-Carlo methods.
